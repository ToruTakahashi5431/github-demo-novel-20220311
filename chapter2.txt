A birdie blitz has delivered Glenn Joyner a second consecutive Settlers Run Legends Pro-Am, finishing two shots clear of Peter Senior at Settlers Run Golf and Country Club on Monday.

A field full of former international tour players found scoring difficult through the morning groups as a moderate southerly pushed across the course yet Joyner had no such problems.

The defending champion rattled off eight birdies in his round of seven-under 65, two clear of Senior (67) with John Wade (69) a further two shots back in outright third.
